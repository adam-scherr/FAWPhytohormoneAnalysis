thesis proposal:
-what is the fall armyworm, biology, ecology, and pest impact
-what we know about gut microbes, esp. those associated with FAW
-what Flor 2019 found
-what gabby ponce found
-Then: your hypothesis and how you plan to analyze it
-then a road map of what you have done and what you are going to specifically to show your line of thought
and how the questions you have are answered by these experiment
	-you don't have to go too deeply into the EXACT experimental methods (instead of bleached with 5% bleach and 0.1% Tween 20 
							for 4 minutes, just say "bleached eggs and dried in laminar flow hood")
